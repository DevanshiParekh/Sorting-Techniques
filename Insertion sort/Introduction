#Introduction to Insertion sort

It is a simple Sorting algorithm which sorts the array by shifting elements one by one. Following are some of the important characteristics of Insertion Sort.

1.It has one of the simplest implementation
2.It is efficient for smaller data sets, but very inefficient for larger lists.
3.Insertion Sort is adaptive, that means it reduces its total number of steps if given a partially sorted list, hence it increases its efficiency.
4.It is better than Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.
5.Its space complexity is less, like Bubble Sorting, insertion sort also requires a single additional memory space.
6.It is Stable, as it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
